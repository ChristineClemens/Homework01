## Christine Clemens - First Homework Submission for SCS Boot Coding Bootcamp

#### For this assignment, I was required to:
..*effectively alter the HTML file provided to include semantic HTML tags
..*ensure that all links are functional
..*add alt attributes for each of the respective img tags
..*add a clear, concise title element
..*ensure that headings are arranged in a logical, sequential order

####Additionally, I was encouraged to:
..*organize the code in a more readable manner
..*add comments to ensure clarity and ease of reading
..*ensure that the CSS style sheet attributes were arranged logically
..*consolidate redundancies in the included stylesheet and alter the HTML document appropriately

*When consolidating elements in the stylesheet, eliminating redundancies led to dramatic formatting changes, and therefore, very little was altered. Likewise, in the HTML file, when changing div tags to nav tags, the unordered list elements were reformatted, so to avoid unnecessary confusion when viewing this source code, these elements were not changed.
